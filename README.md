# Composite Shoreline‚ÄëRetreat Workflow (CoShReW) ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüåäüèñÔ∏èüîú
This repository contains a set of codes developed to estimate long-term shoreline retreat due to sea level rise (SLR) in cros-shore beach profiles. The workflow is grounded on the traditional Bruun's Rule **(Bruun, 1962)**, but incorporates several refinements drawn from prior research, to enhance its applicability to a wider range of coastal environments. The codes are designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy adaptation to site-specific coastal settings.

Apart from the Bruun Rule, the other processes accounted on CoShReW are:
  1. The additional sand demand to fill the berm height along the dry beach after the SLR (Approach from **Rosati et al., 2013)**.
  2. The additional sand demand to fill the estuarine tidal flats after SLR. This process, known as estuary or basin infilling, was identified by **Ranasinghe et al. (2013)** and further researched in subsequent research by **Toimil et al. (2017)**.
  4. The presence of rocky platforms, outcrops or reef barriers. 
  5. The type of backshore (i.e. sandy-dunes and seawalls or cliffs). 
  6. The effect of shoreline changes non related to the SLR. For instance, chronic erosion or accretion rates, which can be included in the calculations as a constant value.

These modifications aim to overcome some of the limitations of the original Bruun's Rule and allow the application of the formulas to site-speciffic complex coastal settings. More details on the methodology proposed here can be found in the documents available in this repository.

### License & language
This repo is open-access and is fully developed in **MATLAB**. 

## Structure
The information is organized as follows: **Codes-documentation** & **Methodology-documentation** 

### Folders
- **Codes-documentation**: This folder contains the codes, some examples of input data so the user can apply it and the respective documentation. 
    The Codes-documentation is divided into 4 subfolders: 

    - [Functions](https://github.com/ArnauGT98/CoShReW/tree/main/Codes-documentation/Functions): Contains the functions required to calculate the shoreline retreat. All these functions are sequentially called from the general script named "General_script.m," which is stored inside the "Script" subfolder.

    - [Input](https://github.com/ArnauGT98/CoShReW/tree/main/Codes-documentation/Input): Contains the Initial Matrix file, which is an example of the input for calculation, and a README file for further details. The Input_Matrix.mat file is a 5x30 matrix: 5 hypothetical beach profiles and their 30 calculation parameters.     

      **Each row corresponds to the 5 hypothetical beach profiles:** 
        - (1) Sandy beach profile 
        - (2) Sandy beach profile with chronic erosion rate 
        - (3) Sandy beach profile with rocky outcrop or reef planform 
        - (4) Sandy beach profile located near an estuary 
        - (5) Sandy beach profile with chronic accretion rate and located near an estuary

      These examples cover a broad range of conditions observed in beach profiles worldwide.  

      **Columns correspond to the 30 input parameters required to run the Gerneral_script.m and calculate long term shoreline retreat.**
